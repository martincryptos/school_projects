# school_projects
Hello, this is a poorly formatted collection of the school projects I was able to rescue through my several reformats. I had a lot of fun learning software, so much that I ignored installation guides warnings of "permanent disk damage" and got myself a whole bunch of it!  I corrupted my drive so bad failing to activate my Venv that I had to reformat more than once.  But here's some of what I have done! I have experience working 'test first', building off a project skeleton, keyword organization, ER diagrams, pgadmin, insomnia, postgres, docker, data structures, nosetests, python builtin tests, etc. 
I am looking for work currently in software engineering. I am descended from engineers, both my parents are engineers, and I have a gift that will prove to be of great value to the industry. I have skills and raw intellect even more, I would love to collaborate with every single smart person I can I absolutely love people! Get at me everyone (:
